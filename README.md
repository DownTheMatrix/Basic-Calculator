# Basic-Calculator
Here's a (very) basic calculator using Python 3.

As this is my first experiment ever with programming in general and Python in particular, I'll welcome any kind of suggestion and support. 

What I tried to do is to create a simple series of commands the user could use to perform basic math operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power and modulo). At the end of the code, I added a loop that allows the user to perform the calculations several times in a row. 

Please feel free to comment/help me to optimize it. As I'm determined to pursue this path, more codes will follow in the near future. Happy programming to everybody :)
